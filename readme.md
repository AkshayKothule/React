The key points are:

1)In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.

2)Different types of updates have different priorities — an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.

3)A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.
